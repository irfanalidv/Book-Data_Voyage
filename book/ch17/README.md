2. **Advanced Optimization Techniques**

   - Hyperparameter optimization (Grid Search, Random Search)
   - Bayesian optimization and Optuna
   - Neural network architecture search (NAS)
   - Multi-objective optimization

3. **Feature Engineering and Selection**

   - Advanced feature creation techniques
   - Automated feature selection algorithms
   - Feature importance and interpretability
   - Domain-specific feature engineering

4. **Model Interpretability and Explainability**

   - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
   - LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Model debugging and validation

5. **Production ML Pipelines**
   - MLflow for experiment tracking
   - Model versioning and deployment
