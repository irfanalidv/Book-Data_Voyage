# Chapter 11: Supervised Learning: Regression

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Implement and evaluate regression algorithms
- Understand linear and non-linear regression approaches
- Handle multicollinearity and feature selection
- Apply regression to prediction and forecasting problems
- Interpret regression coefficients and model diagnostics

## 📚 Chapter Overview

Regression is the foundation of predictive modeling for continuous outcomes. This chapter covers the essential regression techniques, from simple linear models to advanced non-linear approaches, and teaches you how to build reliable prediction models for business and scientific applications.

## 🔍 Key Topics

1. **Regression Fundamentals**
   - Simple vs. multiple linear regression
   - Regression assumptions and diagnostics
   - Model evaluation metrics (R², RMSE, MAE)
   - Residual analysis and model validation

2. **Linear Regression Techniques**
   - Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
   - Ridge and Lasso regularization
   - Elastic net and feature selection
   - Polynomial and interaction terms

3. **Non-Linear Regression**
   - Support vector regression (SVR)
   - Neural network regression
   - Kernel methods and transformations
   - Non-parametric regression approaches

4. **Advanced Regression Topics**
   - Generalized linear models (GLM)
   - Time series regression
   - Bayesian regression
   - Quantile regression

5. **Regression in Practice**
   - Feature engineering for regression
   - Handling outliers and influential points
   - Model interpretation and explainability
   - Deployment and monitoring considerations

## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Chapter 10 (Classification)
- **Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours
- **Hands-on Activities**: Building regression models for real datasets
- **Key Takeaway**: Mastering regression algorithms and applications

## 📖 Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to explore unsupervised learning in Chapter 12, where we'll learn clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
