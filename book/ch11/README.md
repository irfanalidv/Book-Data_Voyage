## üìö Chapter Overview

Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns and structures in data without predefined labels. This chapter covers essential unsupervised learning techniques including clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction methods, now demonstrated using real datasets from sklearn instead of synthetic data. You'll learn to identify natural groupings in biological measurements and reduce high-dimensional medical data for analysis.

   - Choosing appropriate clustering algorithms for different data types

2. **Real Data K-Means Clustering**

   - K-means algorithm implementation on Iris dataset
   - Optimal k selection using elbow method and silhouette analysis
   - Cluster interpretation for species classification
   - Performance evaluation on real biological measurements

3. **Real Data Hierarchical Clustering**

   - Agglomerative clustering on sklearn datasets
   - Dendrogram visualization and interpretation
   - Linkage methods and distance metrics for real data
   - Cluster hierarchy analysis using actual measurements

4. **Real Data Density-Based Clustering**

   - DBSCAN algorithm for outlier detection in real datasets
   - Epsilon and minPts parameter selection
   - Noise point identification in biological data
   - Density-based cluster validation

5. **Real Data Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on high-dimensional datasets
   - t-SNE for visualization of real biological data
   - Explained variance analysis for medical features
