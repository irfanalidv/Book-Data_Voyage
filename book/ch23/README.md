## Running the Code

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Execution
```bash
python ch23_career_development.py
```

## Code Highlights

### Real Dataset Loading for Career Analysis
```python
def load_real_datasets(self):
    """Load real datasets for career development examples."""
    try:
        # Load Breast Cancer dataset (healthcare career)
        breast_cancer = load_breast_cancer()
        X_bc, y_bc = breast_cancer.data, breast_cancer.target
        feature_names = breast_cancer.feature_names
        
        # Create healthcare dataset with career context
        healthcare_data = pd.DataFrame(X_bc, columns=feature_names)
        healthcare_data["diagnosis"] = y_bc
        healthcare_data["patient_id"] = range(1, len(healthcare_data) + 1)
        healthcare_data["department"] = np.random.choice(["Oncology", "Radiology", "Pathology", "Research"], len(healthcare_data))
        healthcare_data["experience_level"] = np.random.choice(["Junior", "Mid-level", "Senior", "Lead"], len(healthcare_data))
        
        datasets["healthcare_career"] = healthcare_data
        print(f"    üìñ Career: Healthcare data science and medical AI")
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to synthetic data
        datasets = self._create_synthetic_fallback()
    return datasets
```

### Job Market Analysis
```python
def create_market_dataset(self):
    """Create job market dataset for career development analysis."""
    # Load real datasets first
    self.load_real_datasets()
    
    # Generate realistic job market data
    n_jobs = 300
    
    job_market_data = {
        "job_id": range(1, n_jobs + 1),
        "title": np.random.choice([
            "Data Scientist", "Machine Learning Engineer", "Data Analyst",
            "MLOps Engineer", "Data Engineer", "AI Research Scientist"
        ], n_jobs, p=[0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05]),
        "company_size": np.random.choice(
            ["Startup", "Mid-size", "Enterprise"], n_jobs, p=[0.4, 0.3, 0.3]
        ),
        "experience_required": np.random.choice(
            ["Entry", "Mid", "Senior", "Lead"], n_jobs, p=[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1]
        ),
        "salary_range": np.random.choice(
            ["$60k-80k", "$80k-120k", "$120k-180k", "$180k+"], n_jobs, p=[0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1]
        ),
        "location": np.random.choice(
            ["Remote", "San Francisco", "New York", "Austin", "Seattle"], n_jobs, p=[0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1]
        )
    }
    
    return pd.DataFrame(job_market_data)
```

### Application Optimization Analysis
```python
def demonstrate_application_optimization(self):
    """Demonstrate application and resume optimization strategies."""
    print("\n3. APPLICATION OPTIMIZATION:")
    print("-" * 35)
    
    # Resume optimization
    print("  üìù Resume Optimization:")
    print("    üîç Keyword optimization for ATS systems")
    print("    üìä Quantified achievements and impact metrics")
    print("    üéØ Tailored content for specific roles")
    print("    üìà Continuous improvement and iteration")
    
    # Portfolio optimization
    print("\n  üé® Portfolio Optimization:")
    print("    üåê Professional website and online presence")
    print("    üìö Project documentation and case studies")
    print("    üîó GitHub optimization and contribution history")
    print("    üì± Social media and professional networking")
```
