# Chapter 2: Python for Data Science

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Write basic Python code and understand syntax fundamentals
- Work with Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
- Use control flow statements (if/else, loops, functions)
- Understand object-oriented programming concepts
- Work with file I/O and error handling
- Use Python packages and virtual environments

## 📚 Chapter Overview

Python is the lingua franca of data science. This chapter will teach you the essential Python programming skills needed to manipulate data, build models, and create visualizations. We'll focus on practical examples that you'll use throughout your data science journey.

## 🔍 Key Topics

1. **Python Basics**

   - Variables, data types, and operators
   - String manipulation and formatting
   - Basic input/output operations

2. **Data Structures**

   - Lists, tuples, and sets
   - Dictionaries and their applications
   - List comprehensions and generators

3. **Control Flow**

   - Conditional statements (if/else)
   - Loops (for, while)
   - Functions and lambda expressions

4. **Object-Oriented Programming**

   - Classes and objects
   - Inheritance and polymorphism
   - Magic methods and properties

5. **File Operations and Error Handling**

   - Reading and writing files
   - Exception handling with try/except
   - Working with different file formats

6. **Python Packages and Environment Management**
   - Installing packages with pip
   - Virtual environments
   - Import statements and modules

## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Basic computer literacy (no programming experience required)
- **Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
- **Hands-on Activities**: Coding exercises and mini-projects
- **Key Takeaway**: Solid Python foundation for data science

## 📖 Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to explore mathematical foundations in Chapter 3, where we'll cover statistics, probability, and linear algebra concepts.
