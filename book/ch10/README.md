# Chapter 10: Feature Engineering and Selection

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Create meaningful features from real sklearn datasets (Iris, Diabetes, Breast Cancer, Wine)
- Handle categorical and numerical variables effectively in biological and medical data
- Engineer temporal and geospatial features from real-world measurements
- Select the most relevant features for modeling using actual data
- Automate feature engineering pipelines with real datasets
- Apply feature engineering techniques to biological measurements and medical diagnostics
- Understand feature importance and selection methods using real-world examples

## üìö Chapter Overview

Feature engineering is the process of creating new variables from existing data that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models. This chapter covers the art and science of transforming raw data into features that improve model performance and interpretability, now demonstrated using real datasets from sklearn instead of synthetic data.

## üîç Key Topics

1. **Real Data Feature Engineering Fundamentals**

   - The importance of feature engineering with actual datasets
   - Domain knowledge and creativity for biological and medical data
   - Feature engineering workflow using real measurements
   - Iterative feature development on sklearn datasets

2. **Real Data Numerical Feature Engineering**

   - Mathematical transformations (log, square root, polynomial) on Iris features
   - Binning and discretization techniques for biological measurements
   - Scaling and normalization methods for real-world data
   - Interaction and combination features from actual measurements

3. **Real Data Categorical Feature Engineering**

   - Encoding strategies (one-hot, label, target) for species classification
   - Feature hashing and embedding for high-cardinality categories
   - High-cardinality categorical handling in real datasets
   - Ordinal encoding and ranking for biological features

4. **Real Data Temporal and Geospatial Features**

   - Date and time feature extraction from real-world data
   - Cyclical encoding of time features for biological rhythms
   - Geographic coordinate transformations for spatial data
   - Distance and proximity calculations using actual measurements

5. **Real Data Feature Selection and Evaluation**
   - Filter, wrapper, and embedded methods on sklearn datasets
   - Feature importance and ranking for biological measurements
   - Correlation and multicollinearity analysis of real features
   - Automated feature selection pipelines with actual data
