# Chapter 16: Time Series Analysis

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Analyze and visualize time series data
- Implement forecasting models and techniques
- Handle seasonality and trends in temporal data
- Detect anomalies and change points
- Build time series models for business applications

## 📚 Chapter Overview

Time series analysis is essential for understanding data that changes over time, from stock prices to sensor readings. This chapter covers the fundamental techniques for analyzing temporal data, building forecasting models, and extracting insights from time-dependent patterns.

## 🔍 Key Topics

1. **Time Series Fundamentals**
   - Time series components (trend, seasonality, noise)
   - Stationarity and differencing
   - Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation
   - Time series visualization techniques

2. **Forecasting Models**
   - Moving averages and exponential smoothing
   - ARIMA and SARIMA models
   - Prophet and Facebook's forecasting tool
   - Neural network approaches (LSTM, TCN)

3. **Seasonality and Decomposition**
   - Seasonal decomposition of time series (STL)
   - Fourier transforms and spectral analysis
   - Seasonal adjustment techniques
   - Holiday and event modeling

4. **Advanced Time Series Topics**
   - Multivariate time series analysis
   - Change point detection
   - Anomaly detection in time series
   - Time series clustering and classification

5. **Time Series in Practice**
   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Model evaluation and validation
   - Production forecasting systems
   - Business applications and case studies

## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Chapter 15 (NLP)
- **Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours
- **Hands-on Activities**: Building time series forecasting models
- **Key Takeaway**: Analyzing and forecasting temporal data

## 📖 Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to explore computer vision in Chapter 17, where we'll learn to process and analyze image data.
