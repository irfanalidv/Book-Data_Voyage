# Chapter 8: Statistical Inference and Hypothesis Testing

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem
- Calculate and interpret confidence intervals
- Perform hypothesis testing with appropriate statistical tests
- Interpret p-values and statistical significance
- Calculate and understand effect sizes (Cohen's d)
- Conduct power analysis for study design

## 📚 Chapter Overview

Statistical inference and hypothesis testing are fundamental concepts in data science that allow us to draw conclusions from sample data and make decisions about populations. This chapter covers the essential statistical methods needed to validate findings and make data-driven decisions.

## 🔍 Key Topics

1. **Sampling and Sampling Distributions**

   - Population vs. sample concepts
   - Central Limit Theorem
   - Sampling distribution properties
   - Expected vs. observed statistics

2. **Confidence Intervals**

   - Point estimation vs. interval estimation
   - Confidence level interpretation
   - Margin of error calculation
   - Coverage probability

3. **Hypothesis Testing**

   - Null and alternative hypotheses
   - Type I and Type II errors
   - P-value interpretation
   - Statistical significance

4. **Effect Size and Power**

   - Cohen's d effect size
   - Practical vs. statistical significance
   - Power analysis
   - Sample size determination

## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Chapters 3, 6-7 (Mathematics, Data Cleaning, EDA)
- **Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
- **Hands-on Activities**: Statistical testing on real datasets
- **Key Takeaway**: Making data-driven decisions with statistical rigor

## 📖 Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to dive into machine learning fundamentals in Chapter 9, where we'll apply statistical thinking to model evaluation and validation.
