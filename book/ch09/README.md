### **Required Libraries**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris, load_diabetes, load_breast_cancer, load_wine
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

```python
# Load real dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Stratified split for classification
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Feature scaling for algorithms that need it
scaler = StandardScaler()

```

### **Model Training and Evaluation**

```python
# Logistic Regression (needs scaled features)
lr_model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=1000)
lr_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
y_pred_lr = lr_model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Random Forest (handles raw features)
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_rf = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Cross-validation
cv_scores_lr = cross_val_score(lr_model, X_train_scaled, y_train, cv=5)
