```

### Execution

```bash
python ch18_model_deployment_mlops.py
```

## Code Highlights

### Real Dataset Loading

```python
def load_real_datasets(self) -> Dict[str, Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]]:
    """Load real datasets for demonstration."""
    print("1. LOADING REAL DATASETS:")
    print("-" * 35)
    datasets = {}
    try:
        print("  Loading Breast Cancer dataset...")
        breast_cancer = load_breast_cancer()
        X_bc, y_bc = breast_cancer.data, breast_cancer.target
        datasets['breast_cancer'] = (X_bc, y_bc)
        print(f"    ‚úÖ {breast_cancer.DESCR.split('\\n')[0]}")
        print(f"    üìä Shape: {X_bc.shape}")
        print(f"    üéØ Target classes: {np.unique(y_bc)}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Error loading datasets: {e}")
        print("    üìù Using synthetic fallback data...")
        datasets = self._create_synthetic_fallback()
    return datasets
```

### Model Packaging and Serialization

```python
def demonstrate_model_packaging(self) -> None:
    """Demonstrate different model packaging techniques."""
    print("\n2. MODEL PACKAGING:")
    print("-" * 35)

    # Pickle serialization
    print("  üì¶ Pickle Serialization:")
    pickle_path = "breast_cancer_model.pkl"
    with open(pickle_path, 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(self.model, f)
    print(f"    ‚úÖ Model saved to {pickle_path}")

    # Joblib serialization (better for large models)
    print("\n  üóúÔ∏è  Joblib Serialization:")
    joblib_path = "breast_cancer_model.joblib"
    joblib.dump(self.model, joblib_path)
    print(f"    ‚úÖ Model saved to {joblib_path}")

    # ONNX conversion (for cross-platform deployment)
    try:
        import onnx
        from skl2onnx import convert_sklearn
        from skl2onnx.common.data_types import FloatTensorType

        n_features = self.scaler.n_features_in_
        initial_type = [("float_input", FloatTensorType([None, n_features]))]
        onx = convert_sklearn(self.model, initial_types=initial_type)

        onnx_path = "breast_cancer_model.onnx"
        with open(onnx_path, "wb") as f:
            f.write(onx.SerializeToString())
        print(f"    ‚úÖ ONNX model saved to {onnx_path}")

    except ImportError:
        print("  ‚ö†Ô∏è  ONNX conversion skipped (skl2onnx not available)")
```
