# Chapter 18: Model Deployment and MLOps

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Deploy machine learning models to production environments
- Implement MLOps practices for model lifecycle management
- Build scalable and reliable ML serving systems
- Monitor model performance and handle model drift
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for machine learning
- Use containerization and orchestration for ML deployment

## üìö Chapter Overview

Model Deployment and MLOps bridge the gap between developing machine learning models and putting them into production. This chapter covers the essential practices, tools, and strategies needed to deploy, monitor, and maintain ML models in real-world environments. You'll learn how to build robust, scalable systems that can handle production workloads.

## üîç Key Topics

1. **Model Deployment Fundamentals**

   - Deployment strategies (batch, real-time, streaming)
   - Model serving architectures and patterns
   - API design and RESTful services
   - Load balancing and scalability considerations

2. **MLOps and Model Lifecycle Management**

   - Model versioning and artifact management
   - Experiment tracking and reproducibility
   - CI/CD pipelines for machine learning
   - Model registry and governance

3. **Production Infrastructure**

   - Containerization with Docker
   - Orchestration with Kubernetes
   - Cloud deployment strategies
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

4. **Model Monitoring and Observability**

   - Performance monitoring and alerting
   - Model drift detection
   - A/B testing and canary deployments
   - Logging and debugging in production

5. **Security and Compliance**

   - Model security best practices
   - Data privacy and GDPR compliance
   - Access control and authentication
   - Audit trails and compliance reporting

## üöÄ Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Chapters 9-17 (Machine Learning through Advanced ML)
- **Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours
- **Hands-on Activities**: Building deployment pipelines and monitoring systems
- **Key Takeaway**: Production-ready ML deployment and operations

## üìñ Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to explore real-world case studies in Chapter 19, where we'll apply all the concepts learned to industry applications and projects.
