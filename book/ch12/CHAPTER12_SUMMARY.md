    def sigmoid(self, x):
        return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
    
    def sigmoid_derivative(self, x):
        return x * (1 - x)
    
    def forward(self, X):
        self.layer1 = self.sigmoid(np.dot(X, self.weights1) + self.bias1)
        self.output = self.sigmoid(np.dot(self.layer1, self.weights2) + self.bias2)
