# Chapter 12: Deep Learning Fundamentals

## Overview

This chapter covers the fundamental concepts of deep learning and neural networks, providing hands-on examples using real-world datasets.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Neural Network Architecture

- **Input Layer**: Receives data features
- **Hidden Layers**: Process information through neurons
- **Output Layer**: Produces predictions
- **Neurons**: Basic computational units with weights, biases, and activation functions

### 2. Activation Functions

- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Most popular activation function
- **Sigmoid**: Outputs values between 0 and 1
- **Tanh**: Outputs values between -1 and 1
- **Softmax**: Used for multi-class classification

### 3. Forward and Backward Propagation

- **Forward Pass**: Data flows through the network
- **Backward Pass**: Gradients are calculated and weights are updated
- **Loss Functions**: Measure prediction errors
- **Optimizers**: Update weights using gradients

### 4. Training Process

- **Data Preparation**: Split into training and testing sets
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize features for better training
- **Training Loop**: Iterative weight updates
- **Validation**: Monitor performance on unseen data

## Real Data Implementation
