## Running the Code

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Execution

```bash
python ch12_deep_learning_fundamentals.py
```

## Code Highlights

### Neural Network Implementation

```python
class SimpleNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        self.weights1 = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size) * 0.01
        self.weights2 = np.random.randn(hidden_size, output_size) * 0.01
        self.bias1 = np.zeros((1, hidden_size))
        self.bias2 = np.zeros((1, output_size))

    def forward(self, X):
        self.layer1 = self.sigmoid(np.dot(X, self.weights1) + self.bias1)
        self.output = self.sigmoid(np.dot(self.layer1, self.weights2) + self.bias2)
        return self.output
```

### Real Data Loading

```python
# Load MNIST dataset (handwritten digits)
mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1, as_frame=False, parser='auto')
X_mnist, y_mnist = mnist.data, mnist.target.astype(int)

# Load California Housing dataset
california = fetch_california_housing()
X_california, y_california = california.data, california.target

# Load Diabetes dataset
diabetes = load_diabetes()
X_diabetes, y_diabetes = diabetes.data, diabetes.target
```
