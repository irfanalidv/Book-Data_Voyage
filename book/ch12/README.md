# Chapter 12: Unsupervised Learning

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Implement clustering algorithms for data segmentation
- Apply dimensionality reduction techniques
- Discover hidden patterns in unlabeled data
- Use association rule learning for market basket analysis
- Evaluate unsupervised learning results effectively

## 📚 Chapter Overview

Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns in data without predefined labels. This chapter covers clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning - powerful techniques for exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, and pattern discovery in business applications.

## 🔍 Key Topics

1. **Clustering Fundamentals**
   - What is clustering and when to use it
   - Distance metrics and similarity measures
   - Clustering evaluation and validation
   - Choosing the right number of clusters

2. **Clustering Algorithms**
   - K-means clustering and variations
   - Hierarchical clustering (agglomerative, divisive)
   - DBSCAN and density-based clustering
   - Gaussian mixture models (GMM)

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Principal component analysis (PCA)
   - t-SNE and UMAP for visualization
   - Factor analysis and ICA
   - Autoencoders and neural approaches

4. **Association Rule Learning**
   - Market basket analysis
   - Apriori algorithm and FP-growth
   - Rule evaluation metrics
   - Applications in retail and marketing

5. **Advanced Unsupervised Techniques**
   - Anomaly detection methods
   - Self-organizing maps (SOM)
   - Topic modeling and LDA
   - Deep clustering approaches

## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Chapter 11 (Regression)
- **Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours
- **Hands-on Activities**: Clustering and dimensionality reduction projects
- **Key Takeaway**: Discovering patterns in unlabeled data

## 📖 Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to learn model evaluation and validation in Chapter 13, where we'll master techniques for assessing model performance.
