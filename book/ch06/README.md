# Chapter 6: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Identify and handle common data quality issues
- Implement systematic data cleaning workflows
- Deal with missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies
- Transform data into analysis-ready formats
- Automate data preprocessing pipelines

## 📚 Chapter Overview

Data cleaning is often the most time-consuming part of data science, but it's crucial for reliable results. This chapter covers systematic approaches to identifying and resolving data quality issues, transforming raw data into clean, consistent datasets ready for analysis.

## 🔍 Key Topics

1. **Data Quality Assessment**
   - Completeness, accuracy, and consistency checks
   - Data profiling and summary statistics
   - Duplicate detection and removal
   - Data type validation and conversion

2. **Handling Missing Data**
   - Types of missing data (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
   - Deletion strategies and implications
   - Imputation methods (mean, median, mode, advanced)
   - Missing data visualization and analysis

3. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**
   - Statistical outlier detection methods
   - Domain-specific outlier identification
   - Outlier treatment strategies
   - Robust statistical methods

4. **Data Transformation**
   - Normalization and standardization
   - Log and power transformations
   - Categorical encoding techniques
   - Date and time feature engineering

5. **Automated Data Cleaning**
   - Data cleaning pipeline design
   - Validation rules and constraints
   - Error handling and logging
   - Reproducible cleaning workflows

## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Chapters 2-5 (Python through Data Collection)
- **Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours
- **Hands-on Activities**: Cleaning real-world messy datasets
- **Key Takeaway**: Systematic data quality improvement skills

## 📖 Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to explore exploratory data analysis in Chapter 7, where we'll use clean data to discover patterns and insights.
