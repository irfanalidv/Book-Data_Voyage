## Running the Code

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels requests
```

### Execution

```bash
python ch15_time_series_analysis.py
```

## Code Highlights

### Real COVID-19 Data Loading

```python
def load_real_time_series():
    datasets = {}
    try:
        print("  Loading real COVID-19 data (example of time series)...")
        covid_url = "https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/historical/all?lastdays=365"
        response = requests.get(covid_url, timeout=10)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            covid_data = response.json()
            # Process COVID data
            covid_ts = pd.Series(covid_data['cases'])
            covid_ts.index = pd.to_datetime(covid_ts.index)
            covid_ts_sampled = covid_ts.resample('D').sum().fillna(0)
            datasets['covid'] = covid_ts_sampled
        else:
            raise Exception("Failed to fetch COVID data")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Could not load COVID data: {e}")
        print("    üìù Creating realistic time series simulation...")
        # Fallback to synthetic COVID-like data
    return datasets
```

### Time Series Decomposition

```python
def decompose_time_series(data):
    """Perform seasonal decomposition of time series."""
    # Additive decomposition
    decomposition = seasonal_decompose(data, period=7, extrapolate_tukey=True)

    # Extract components
    trend = decomposition.trend
    seasonal = decomposition.seasonal
    residual = decomposition.resid

    return trend, seasonal, residual
```

### Stationarity Testing

```python
def test_stationarity(timeseries):
    """Perform ADF and KPSS tests for stationarity."""
    # Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
    adf_result = adfuller(timeseries)

    # KPSS test
    kpss_result = kpss(timeseries)

    print(f"ADF Test:")
    print(f"  ADF Statistic: {adf_result[0]:.4f}")
    print(f"  p-value: {adf_result[1]:.4f}")

    print(f"\nKPSS Test:")
    print(f"  KPSS Statistic: {kpss_result[0]:.4f}")
    print(f"  p-value: {kpss_result[1]:.4f}")
```
