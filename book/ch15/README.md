# Chapter 15: Natural Language Processing

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Preprocess and analyze text data effectively
- Implement text classification and sentiment analysis
- Use word embeddings and language models
- Apply NLP techniques to real-world problems
- Build conversational AI and chatbots

## üìö Chapter Overview

Natural Language Processing enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This chapter covers the fundamental techniques for working with text data, from basic preprocessing to advanced language models, and shows you how to apply NLP to business applications.

## üîç Key Topics

1. **Text Preprocessing Fundamentals**
   - Tokenization and text cleaning
   - Stop word removal and stemming
   - Part-of-speech tagging
   - Named entity recognition (NER)

2. **Text Representation**
   - Bag of words and TF-IDF
   - Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
   - Contextual embeddings (BERT, GPT)
   - Document embeddings and topic modeling

3. **Text Classification and Analysis**
   - Sentiment analysis techniques
   - Text categorization and tagging
   - Spam detection and content moderation
   - Multi-label text classification

4. **Advanced NLP Applications**
   - Machine translation and language generation
   - Question answering systems
   - Text summarization and extraction
   - Conversational AI and chatbots

5. **NLP in Production**
   - Text preprocessing pipelines
   - Model deployment and scaling
   - Multilingual NLP considerations
   - Ethical considerations in NLP

## üöÄ Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Chapter 14 (Deep Learning)
- **Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours
- **Hands-on Activities**: Building NLP applications
- **Key Takeaway**: Processing and analyzing text data

## üìñ Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to explore time series analysis in Chapter 16, where we'll learn to analyze temporal data.
