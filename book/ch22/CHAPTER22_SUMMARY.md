        healthcare_data['region'] = np.random.choice(['Urban', 'Suburban', 'Rural'], len(healthcare_data))
        
        datasets['healthcare_ml'] = healthcare_data
        print(f"    📖 Project: Healthcare ML for early cancer detection")

    projects = []
    
    # Healthcare ML Project
    healthcare_project = {
        "project_id": "HC001",
        "title": "Breast Cancer Diagnosis ML Model",
        "domain": "Healthcare",

    }
    projects.append(healthcare_project)
    
    # Quality Analysis Project
    quality_project = {
        "project_id": "QA001",
        "title": "Wine Quality Classification System",
        "domain": "Manufacturing",
        "dataset": "Wine Quality Dataset",
        "techniques": ["Data Analysis", "Classification", "Quality Control"],
        "impact": "Quality assurance automation",
        "complexity": "Intermediate",
        "github_url": "https://github.com/username/wine-quality-analysis",
        "live_demo": "https://wine-quality-demo.herokuapp.com"
    }
    projects.append(quality_project)
    
    return pd.DataFrame(projects)
```

### 3. Technical Implementation
```python
def demonstrate_technical_implementation(self):
    """Demonstrate technical implementation of portfolio projects."""
    print("\n3. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:")
    print("-" * 35)
