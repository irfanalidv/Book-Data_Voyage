## Running the Code

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Execution
```bash
python ch22_portfolio_development.py
```

## Code Highlights

### Real Dataset Loading
```python
def load_real_datasets(self):
    """Load real datasets for portfolio project demonstration."""
    try:
        # Load Breast Cancer dataset (healthcare ML)
        breast_cancer = load_breast_cancer()
        X_bc, y_bc = breast_cancer.data, breast_cancer.target
        feature_names = breast_cancer.feature_names
        
        # Create healthcare dataset with patient context
        healthcare_data = pd.DataFrame(X_bc, columns=feature_names)
        healthcare_data['diagnosis'] = y_bc
        healthcare_data['patient_id'] = range(1, len(healthcare_data) + 1)
        healthcare_data['age_group'] = np.random.choice(['25-35', '36-45', '46-55', '56-65', '65+'], len(healthcare_data))
        healthcare_data['region'] = np.random.choice(['Urban', 'Suburban', 'Rural'], len(healthcare_data))
        
        datasets['healthcare_ml'] = healthcare_data
        print(f"    üìñ Project: Healthcare ML for early cancer detection")
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to synthetic data
        datasets = self._create_synthetic_fallback()
    return datasets
```

### Portfolio Project Design
```python
def create_portfolio_dataset(self):
    """Create portfolio project dataset from real data examples."""
    # Load real datasets first
    self.load_real_datasets()
    
    # Create portfolio project metadata
    projects = []
    
    # Healthcare ML Project
    healthcare_project = {
        "project_id": "HC001",
        "title": "Breast Cancer Diagnosis ML Model",
        "domain": "Healthcare",
        "dataset": "Breast Cancer Wisconsin",
        "techniques": ["Machine Learning", "Classification", "Feature Engineering"],
        "impact": "Early cancer detection",
        "complexity": "Advanced",
        "github_url": "https://github.com/username/breast-cancer-ml",
        "live_demo": "https://breast-cancer-ml-demo.herokuapp.com"
    }
    projects.append(healthcare_project)
    
    return pd.DataFrame(projects)
```

### Technical Implementation
```python
def demonstrate_technical_implementation(self):
    """Demonstrate technical implementation of portfolio projects."""
    print("\n3. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:")
    print("-" * 35)
    
    # Healthcare ML Implementation
    print("  üè• Healthcare ML Project Implementation:")
    print("    üìä Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (569 samples, 30 features)")
    print("    üîß Techniques: Feature scaling, Random Forest, Cross-validation")
    print("    üìà Performance: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score")
    print("    üöÄ Deployment: Model serialization, API development")
```
