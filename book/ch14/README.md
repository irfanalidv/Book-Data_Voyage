## Running the Code

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn opencv-python pillow
```

### Execution

```bash
python ch14_computer_vision_fundamentals.py
```

## Code Highlights

### Realistic Image Generation

```python
def load_real_images():
    images = {}
    size = 100

    # Create a realistic landscape-like image
    landscape = np.zeros((size, size, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    # Sky gradient (blue to light blue)
    for i in range(size):
        landscape[i, :, 0] = int(100 + (i / size) * 100)  # Blue channel
        landscape[i, :, 1] = int(150 + (i / size) * 50)   # Green channel
        landscape[i, :, 2] = int(200 + (i / size) * 55)   # Red channel

    # Add terrain texture
    terrain = np.random.randint(50, 150, (size//2, size, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    landscape[size//2:, :] = terrain

    images['landscape'] = landscape
    return images
```

### Feature Extraction Pipeline

```python
def extract_features(image):
    """Extract comprehensive features from image."""
    # Statistical features
    stats = [
        np.mean(image), np.std(image), np.min(image),
        np.max(image), np.median(image), np.var(image)
    ]

    # Texture features (simplified LBP)
    texture = extract_texture_features(image)

    # Edge features
    edges = extract_edge_features(image)

    return np.concatenate([stats, texture, edges])
```

### Image Classification

```python
# Create synthetic dataset with realistic patterns
X = np.array(X)  # Feature vectors
y = np.array(y)  # Labels

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Train classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
