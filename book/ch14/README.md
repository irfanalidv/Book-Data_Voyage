   - Backpropagation and gradient descent
   - Loss functions and optimization

2. **Deep Learning Architectures**
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
   - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
   - Attention mechanisms and transformers

3. **Training Deep Networks**
   - Data preprocessing and augmentation
   - Regularization techniques (dropout, batch norm)
   - Learning rate scheduling
   - Early stopping and model checkpointing

4. **Transfer Learning and Pre-trained Models**
   - Using pre-trained models (ResNet, VGG, BERT)
   - Fine-tuning for specific tasks
   - Feature extraction and transfer
   - Domain adaptation techniques

5. **Deep Learning in Practice**
   - Framework selection (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
   - GPU acceleration and distributed training
