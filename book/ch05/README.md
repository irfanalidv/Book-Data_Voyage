# Chapter 5: Data Collection and Storage

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Design and implement data collection strategies
- Work with APIs and web scraping techniques
- Understand database fundamentals and SQL
- Design efficient data storage solutions
- Build data pipelines for automated collection

## 📚 Chapter Overview

Data collection is the first step in any data science project. This chapter covers practical techniques for gathering data from various sources, storing it efficiently, and building automated data pipelines. We'll focus on real-world scenarios and best practices for scalable data collection.

## 🔍 Key Topics

1. **Data Collection Strategies**
   - Survey design and implementation
   - Sensor data collection and IoT
   - Social media and web data harvesting
   - Business process data capture

2. **APIs and Web Scraping**
   - RESTful API design and consumption
   - Web scraping with BeautifulSoup and Scrapy
   - Rate limiting and ethical scraping
   - Authentication and authorization

3. **Database Fundamentals**
   - Relational database design (SQL)
   - NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra)
   - Database normalization and optimization
   - Query optimization and indexing

4. **Data Pipeline Design**
   - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
   - Batch vs. streaming data processing
   - Data validation and quality checks
   - Error handling and monitoring

5. **Cloud Storage and Big Data**
   - AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage
   - Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
   - Data lakes and data warehouses
   - Cost optimization and performance tuning

## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Chapters 2-4 (Python, Statistics, Data Types)
- **Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours
- **Hands-on Activities**: Building data collection scripts and pipelines
- **Key Takeaway**: Practical data collection and storage skills

## 📖 Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to learn data cleaning and preprocessing in Chapter 6, where we'll transform raw collected data into analysis-ready datasets.
